  <h2 class="protitle1">Why companionship?</h2>
  <h6 class="prodescribe1">This project required designers make people be willing to share a scarce resource. I took companionship as my topic because I was in a kind of sorrow and I want to help myself get rid of it. I interviewed 3 friends from different age and different culture background. I asked them to tell me a story of being helpless and upset and took sketch note. Interestingly, I found a pattern that all of them got rid of sorrow by talking to people. Both sharing their stories and listening to other stories help them move on. Therefore, I settled down with companionship.</h6>

  <h6 class="prodescribe">“Companionship” is an interactive story project. The assignment asked students to find a scarce resource and develop a story to encourage readers to share the resource; the resource chosen by me was Companionship. With the help of the Sifteo cubes, readers could engage in this Companionship with 5 Non-player characters - the action of combining cubes enabled players to better engage with the story.</h6>

  <h2 class="protitle1">Why companionship?</h2>
  <h6 class="prodescribe1">I chose the topic of companionship because I had found feeling low and I needed help to get out of it. So, I interviewed 3 friends of different ages and cultural backgrounds. I asked them to tell me a story of being helpless and upset and sketched notes. Interestingly, I found a pattern; that all of them got rid of their sorrow by talking to others. Both sharing their stories and listening others' stories helped them move on. I found myself greatly enjoying my topic choice, because it also helped me out.</h6>

   <h4 class="quotation">"I want to be able to be myself, to open my heart. I want to be emotional avaliable to what to love and feel."<br/>-Jose (Interviewee)</h4>
   <h4 class="quotation">“I encountered culture shock during travling in India. When I came back, I felt no one understood me. It got better after I talked with my friends and they understood.”
<br/>-Joyna (Interviewee)</h4>
  <h3 class="keypoint"><span>Insights:</span><br/>
 People tend to talk to others to get rid of sorrow and loneliness because sharing makes them understand others and feel like they are not alone.<br/><br/> However, some people do not share and listen to others. This is the story that try to help them find the way to get rid of their sorrow and loneliness.</h3>


 <h2 class="protitle1">How to share companionship?</h2>
   <h6 class="prodescribe1">We could focus on creating characters in different locations on a map. This provided players discovery by letting users walk around and talk to different characters.</h6>
